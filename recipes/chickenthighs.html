    </h3>

        <li>
            4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon smoked paprika
        </li>
        <li>
            ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>
            Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush skins with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side
            down, in a single layer on a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning mixture
            evenly over thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle with remaining seasoning. Arrange thighs, skin-side
            up, in a single layer in the air fryer basket.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook in the preheated air fryer until thighs are brown and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An
            instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
